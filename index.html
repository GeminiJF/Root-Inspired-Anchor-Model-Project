<h2>
  Introduction
</h2>
<br/>

<h3> Motivation:
</h3>
<img src= "pictures/practical use.jpg" width = "525" height = "360" alt="Root Inspire Model Practical example" align = "center">
<p> Just as the picture suggests, A wall separating two platforms has different elevations. The wall shown in the picture has a tendency to incline to the right because the mass on the left side of the wall is much greater. Therefore, we attach this root-inspired anchor model into the wall, which increases the resistance against the force on the left side.
</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p> During experiments, Dr. Mallet took steps of embedding the model into the soil, and then utilized machines to vertically pull up the anchor. After repetitive experiments using different models and particulates, approximately 200 data sets are collected.

<h2><b> Problems that we are striving to solve
  </b>
</h2>
<p>
  <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
  <li> How different features contribute to the pullout capacity of our root-inspired Model? </li>
  <li> How accurate datasets can predict the pullout force? </li>
  <li> How different algorithms(generative & discriminative) lead to an accuracy difference? </li>
  <li> How unique features (independent from other features) vs interdependent features lead to different predictive models? </li>
</ul>

  Project Objective
</h3>
<p>
  The objective of this project is to develop a machine-learning-based method to predict and calculate the pullout force. To make this project more feasible to carry out, we will only use the features that are unique (not dependent on other properties).
</p>
<p> Our group implements different algorithms to yield the best prediction models.
