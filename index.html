<p> Just as the picture suggests, A wall separating two platforms has different elevations. The wall shown in the picture has a tendency to incline to the right because the mass on the left side of the wall is much greater. Therefore, we attach this root-inspired anchor model into the wall, which increases the resistance against the force on the left side.

<br/>
<p> During experiments, Dr. Mallet took steps of embedding the model into the soil, and then utilized machines to vertically pull up the anchor. After repetitive experiments using different models and particulates, approximately 200 data sets are collected.
