  Introduction
</h2>

<h3> Motivation:
</h3>

<p> Just as the picture suggests, A wall separating two platforms has different elevations. The wall shown in the picture has a tendency to incline to the right because the mass on the left side of the wall is much greater. Therefore, we attach this root-inspired anchor model into the wall, which provides the resistance against the force on the left side.
</p>
<br/>

<p>
  In the real world setting, this model is of great significance! For example, we can utilize this model in transmission towers. Because of the wind blowing and the weight of the wire, sometimes, the foundation is not solid enough and may get uplifted. Then, the anchored model came into practice. People can implement them down the ground, and make the structure as solid as possible. Other than that, we can also utilize the same model in retaining wall, solidifying dams, and reinforcing the slope.
</p>
<br/>
<p> During experiments, Dr. Mallet took steps of embedding the model into the soil, and then utilized machines to vertically pull up the anchor. After repetitive experiments using different models and particulates, approximately 200 data sets are collected.

  Project Objective
</h2>
<p>
  The objective of this project is to develop a machine-learning-based method to predict and calculate the pullout force. To make this project more feasible to carry out, we will only use the features that are unique (not dependent on other properties).
</p>
<p> Our group implements different algorithms to yield the best prediction models.
